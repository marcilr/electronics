Premium Digital Stainless Steel Calipers
PRODUCT ID: 1724
price: $59.95
The most useful tool we've ever laid our hands on.
These calipers are really good quality and an excellent
choice if you need something better than a cheap
'disposable' pair of digital calipers but you're not
quite ready for a set of high-end Mitsutoyo calipers.
These digital calipers work by having a capacitive sensor
instead of a rack and pinion, so they never go out of
alignment even if, say, you accidentally drop them
(a few times).  One button converts the measurement from
millimeters to inches and they're perfect for measuring
components.  We use this type of calipers in the Adafruit
shop and they're really good for any purpose from
manufacturing to laser cutting to electronics

Check out our calipers tutorial here.

While the Premium Digital Calipers aren't as
fancy as the Mituyoyo Digital Calipers,

many of the same instructions apply!
