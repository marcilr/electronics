Glossary


dry contact - A "dry contact" refers to a set of metal contacts that are
  usually open to prevent a circuit, and then something will trigger them to
  close, completing a circuit.  A "dry contact" usually means that the metal
  contacts themselves don't really care which direction the electricity flows
  nor do they care if the electricity is AC or DC.  (Note that I said
  "usually"!) Some contacts are designed for specific electrical flow
  direction, type of current, etc.  A dry contact is a general, all-purpose
  contact.

  Very good details here inclusing pull-up or pull-down with dry contacts.
